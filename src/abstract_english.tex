The porpose of this study is proposing the system to solve an overhead of communication costs and human resources in a staging
environment of geographically distributed systems.
The test for geographically distributed system such as P2P network, which is known as the basic technology of blockchain, is harder
than client-server software.
This is because it needs many communications and human resources to build a test staging environment consisted by distributed nodes
that are located at remote points.

Therefore, we propose the integrated staging environment using OpenVPN and Kubernetes.
The system can oprate all distributed nodes from a specific point at the same time, it is possible to solve the overhead of
communication costs and human resources.

After we implemented this system, confirm that it can deploy and update, stop the application on all distributed nodes.
It proves that the proposal in this study is feasible.

As an evaluation, we verified how much difference in the number of work processes occurred when BSafe.network did not use this
system and when it was used.
As a result, when this system is used, the number of processes can be greatly reduced.
Communication costs and human resource overhead can be eliminated.

Therefore, this study will promote the efficiency of test work in the development of geographically distributed systems, and will
help to improve the robustness of the system.
